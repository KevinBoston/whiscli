# Whiscli

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/whiscli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'whiscli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install whiscli

## Usage

Welcome to WhisCLI! To use, type `./bin/whiscli` and follow instructions. The prompt will provide a list of whisky categories for you to explore and will provide further information on the specific bottle you select. Enjoy adding the items to your wishlist and maybe go get one after you're done!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
